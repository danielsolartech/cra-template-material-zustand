# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the [cra-template-material-zustand](https://github.com/danielsolartech/cra-template-material-zustand).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

`npm run test`

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames includes the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for more information.

`npm run lint`

`npm run lint:fix`

`npm run format`
